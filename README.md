# AIM:

To create a basic singly linked list node in C++ and display the data stored in a single node along with its next pointer.
To implement a singly linked list in C++ that allows insertion of nodes at the head and displays the entire linked list.

# Apparatus:

A computer with a C++ compiler (like g++, clang++)

# Theory:

1.Linked List: A data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

2.Node Class: This represents a single element of the linked list. It contains:

3.data: Stores the actual data (here, an integer).

4.next: A pointer to the next node.

5.Single Node: This example demonstrates only one node creation and displays its data and pointer.

6.Dynamic Memory Allocation: The node is created on the heap using new.

7.Display Function: Prints the node's data and the value of the pointer (next) which is NULL since there's no next node.
Step 1: Start

Begin the program execution.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Define the Node Class

1.create a class named Node with:

>An integer variable data to store the value of the node.

>A pointer next of type Node* to store the address of the next node.

A constructor that:

>Takes an integer as input.

>Initializes data with the input value.

>Initializes next with NULL.

>A member function display() to:

Print the value of data.

Print the memory address stored in next.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Create a Node in main()

In the main() function:

Create a pointer l1 of type Node*.

Use new to dynamically allocate a new Node with value 8.

l1 now points to this new node.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Call the display() Function

Use the pointer l1 to call the display() function.

The function prints:

The value stored in data (which is 8).

The address in next (which is NULL, or shown as 0 or (nil) depending on the system).

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: End Program

Return from the main() function.

Program ends successfully.

# CODE 2:
Step 1: Start the Program

Begin execution.

âœ… Step 2: Define the node Class

Create a class called node to represent a single element in a linked list.

Inside the node class:

Define data members:

int data â†’ to store the value of the node.

node* next â†’ a pointer to the next node in the list.

Constructor:

Input: int n

Set data = n

Set next = NULL (meaning this is the last node for now)

âœ… Step 3: Define the insert_head() Function

Purpose: Add a new node at the beginning of the linked list.

Input:

node*& head â†’ a reference to the head of the list.

int data â†’ value to be inserted.

Steps:

Create a new node using new_node = new node(data) â†’ this allocates memory and initializes data and next = NULL.

Set new_node->next = head â†’ this links the new node to the existing list.

Update head = new_node â†’ this makes the new node the first (head) of the list.

âœ… Step 4: Define the display() Function

Purpose: Print all values in the linked list.

Input:

node* head â†’ starting point of the list.

Steps:

Set a temporary pointer temp = head.

Loop while temp != NULL:

Print temp->data followed by "->".

Move to the next node: temp = temp->next.

After the loop, print "NULL" to indicate end of the list.

âœ… Step 5: Inside main() Function

Initialize the head pointer:

node* head = NULL â†’ list is currently empty.

Insert nodes:

Call insert_head(head, 1):

Creates a new node with value 1, sets it as the head.

Call insert_head(head, 2):

Creates a new node with value 2, places it before the existing node 1.

Head now points to 2.

Call insert_head(head, 3):

Creates a new node with value 3, places it before node 2.

Head now points to 3.
